# ZSH Repo
This is meant to be where I house useful tool, tips, and applications for increasing productivity.  This is also meant as a backup in case I need to reload any of these onto another computer.

### Contents:
* Z-shell profile with scripts, aliases etc (check out the nifty emoji switch when a command errors out!)
* Z-shell custom plugin script for changing color of terminal when ssh
* list of programs used and other helpful links
